<h1>The Best Movies According to Rob</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>I like this movie because of the ending twist that I was not able to predict. I also love the idea of standing up against corporate greed.</p>

<h3>The Prestige</h3>
<p>Another movie that did not let me know its secret until the very end. It is also a movie that show how people who are passionate about anything in their life can achieve great things if they give in to their passion.</p>

<h3>V for Vendetta</h3>
A revolution movie. It got my attention just by the line "People should not be afraid of their Government. Their Government should be afraid of their people" alone.
